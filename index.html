        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>
            DIG is a student-run game development studio that aims to develop and publish a game.
            We also host networking events, workshops, and social events for students of all backgrounds, including Computer Science, Arts, and Business. Our projects, which include both games and digital productions, require a range of interdisciplinary 
            skills. Whether you're looking to learn new skills or just have fun, DIG has something for you.
